  AIM-MAT v 1.5

<ul>
  <li>To install AIM-MAT, recursively add the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">aim-mat</font>, 
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">tools</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">demo</font> 
    folders to your MATLAB path</li>
  <li>To test the installation, run <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">demo_aim2006_gtfb</font> 
    from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">demo</font> folder, this 
    runs the analysis of the four scaled vowel sounds seen in the documentation. 
    The script opens six figure windows, one for each stage of the model, and 
    plots the output of each stage for the four vowels.</li>
<li>To run AIM with a GUI type <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">aim</font> 
  at the prompt</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Requirements </h2>
<p>AIM-MAT was developed using MATLAB 7 and above.</p>
<p>The package should work on any platform supporting MATLAB 6.5 or above, with 
  the Signal Processing Toolbox installed.</p>
<p>AIM-MAT  has been tested while in development on the following platforms:</p>
<ul><li>Windows XP with MATLAB versions 6.5, 7.1, R2006a</li>
<li>Mac OS X (version 10.4 onwards) with MATLAB version 7.1 and R2007b</li>
<li>Ubuntu Linux with MATLAB versions 7.1, R2007b and R2008a</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Tips for getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li>If AIM-MAT  is started from the command-line with no parameters, a file-open dialogue box will be displayed. Select the .wav or .aiff file you wish to process using this box.</li>
  <li>AIM-MAT  is a MATLAB implementation of the Auditory Image Model. The buttons 
    along the top of the main AIM-MAT  window correspond to stages of this model. 
    The model runs from left to right across the window. The calculation of any 
    section of the model is contingent upon the calculation of the stage before 
    it.</li>
  <li>To enable any of the buttons at the top of the AIM-MAT window, simply check 
    the 'recalculate' checkbox below that button. This will automatically check 
    any other parts of the module that need recalculating.</li>
	
  <li>If any section of the model needs calculating, the surround of the button 
    for that section will light up <font color="#0033FF">blue</font>. If the section 
    needs <em>re</em>calculating the button surround will light up <font color="#990000">red</font>. 
    Sections of the model which have been calculated have button surrounds in 
    <font color="#006600">dark green</font>. The section whose output is currently 
    displayed has the button surround illumninated in <font color="#33CC00">bright 
    green</font>.</li>
<li>To get the contents of the AIM-MAT  workspace into the MATLAB command line workspace at any point, simply select 'Copy current data to workspace (data)' from the 'Edit' menu.</li>
  <li>The plot window will show no activity for the first few frames of the output 
    of the SAI module. This is because it takes a finite time for the stabilised 
    image to build up. Use the 'Frame #' slider in the bottom left of the GUI 
    to move on a few frames and see the image to build up.</li>
  <li>The autoscaling function should scale each plot to a reasonable level, however, 
    if the activity in the plot window looks to large or too small, you can use 
    the 'autoscale' button to re-run the autoscaling, or use the scaling slider 
    to choose a suitable scale for the plot.</li>
  <li>AIM-MAT plots are just MATLAB figures; they can be manipulated using the 
    MATLAB 7 plot tools, or command line functions.</li>
  <li>AIM-MAT  stores parameters for a processed file in a subdirectory of that 
    file's directory, named after the file without the extension. If you wish 
    AIM-MAT  to start afresh on working on a file, delete this subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
