function FS% status = FS('Command')%% MEX file to control filesharing.  This routine is primarily% intended to be called at the start of experiments to turn% filesharing off and at the end to turn it back on again.  You% really don't want filesharing running when you are doing anything% where timing matters.%% status = FS('Check')%   -3 if filesharing is off or not supported.%   -2 if it is starting up.%   -1 if it is on.%    n number of minutes to shut down, where n > 0.%% status = FS('Off')%   Turn filesharing off.  Variable status is as follows:%		  0  = no error (turned off, was off, or no filesharing).%% status = FS('On')%	  Turn filesharing on.  Variable status is as follows:%     0  = no error (file sharing turned on or was on).%    -1  = no file sharing supported, can't turn on.%% CAUTION: When writing programs that other people may use,% we suggest asking for permission to turn off filesharing% before doing so. Someone may run your program on an important% file server. See ScreenTest.m as an example.%% NOTE: We have only tested this routine with Filesharing (the stuff% that comes standard with the Mac OS, not with Appleshare (the% server software you can buy separately.)  It should work with% Appleshare, but there are some message pointers that are% irrelevant with Filesharing that may matter with Appleshare.% We think we set them up properly, but we couldn't test it.  In% any case, if you're running experiments on a machine with % Appleshare running, you should probably rethink what you are % doing.%% See also FileShare, which provides a nicer interface to FS.% 7/2/95    dhb   Wrote it.% 2/9/96    dhb   Re-wrote and added turning on feature.% 3/20/97   dhb   More complete status reporting, other status mods.% 6/3/97	dgp   Updated
