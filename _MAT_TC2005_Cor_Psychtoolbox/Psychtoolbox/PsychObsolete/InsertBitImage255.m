function InsertBitImage255% InsertBitImage255(image,bitImage,i)% % OBSOLETE - Use Screen instead. See MovieDemo.% % MEX file to convert a matrix image into an 8 bit image and insert% it into a sequence of images to be played by% Screen('BlitBitImage',...);% % 'image' is an m by n image to be inserted into 'bitImage' as image% number i in the sequence.  'image' should have vales between 0 and% 255.% % NOTE: Unlike typical Matlab routines, InsertBitImage255 changes% 'bitImage', rather than returning a new matrix.% % NOTE: 'bitImage' should be initialized in advance by calling% ZeroBitImage.  Do not allocate it by hand -- the algorithm for% choosing the size is very tricky.% % NOTE: Do not try to interpret bitImage numbers in Matlab, since% Matlab will interpret the entries as doubles.% 6/7/95	gmb, dhb	Cleaned a little bit.% 6/13/95	dhb				Updated to emphasize use of ZeroBitImage.% 7/11/00		dgp		  Note obsolescence.error('OBSOLETE: Use Screen ''PutImage'' instead.');
