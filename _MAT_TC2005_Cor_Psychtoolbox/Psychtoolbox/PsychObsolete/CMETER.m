function CMETER% CMETER('Command');%% Send commands to the PhotoResearch PR-650 colorimeter.%% 	OBSOLETE. Please use PsychSerial.mex instead.% 	As far as I know, all functions performed by CMETER can now be% 	accomplished by PsychSerial.mex. We will retain CMETER.mex for a while, % 	so as not to break old programs,% 	but it will go away someday. Denis 7/13/00.%  % status = CMETER('Init')%		The status is 0 if OK, -1 if not OK.%		On the PC, you can also provided a com port name as an optional%		second argument. The portName is 'COM2' by default. It can also %		be 'COM1', 'COM3', 'COM4', etc.,	if the cmeter is actually connected %		to one of these other ports.%% status = CMETER('Measure',[timeout])%		The routine returns after taking a measurement or after timeout.%		Default timeout is 30 sec.%%		The status 0 if OK, -1 if no response (timeout),%		and the measurement quality code otherwise.%		See Colorimeter manual page B-27 for quality codes.%% spectrum = CMETER('Spectrum')%   Obtains the spectral data from the last measurement taken.%   Converts from power density to power by multiplying raw%   returned values by the meter's wavelength spacing.%   OUTPUT%			Spectral data in the form of a 100 row, 2 column matrix.%			First column is the wavelength in nm.%			Second column is the intensity at each wavelength.%			Range of wavelengths is 380 to 780 in 4 nm steps.%% status = CMETER('SetUnits',units)%		Sets the type of units for returned luminosity data.% 	INPUT%			0 - English units: footLamberts and footcandles.%			1 - Metric(SI) units: cd*m-2 and lux%		OUTPUT%			status - 0 if OK, something else if not.%% status = CMETER('SetParams',synch,integration,avgcnt)%		Sets the synch, integration time, and averaging count%		for the colorimeter.%%   A problem is that these get reset each time CMSetUnits%		is called.  This needs to be fixed before this routine%		is of much use.  Probably the correct thing to do is to store%   some globals in a single driver routine and interface to this%   with various M-files.%		OUTPUT%			status - 0 if OK, return code if not OK%% response = CMETER('Cmd','command string')%		Sends the command string to the colorimeter.% 	INPUT%			Command string (see p. B-8 ff of the operating manual).%		OUTPUT%			String returned by the meter in response to the command.%%			Note: This function will not return the spectral data properly %     because the default timeout value is too short to allow%     completion of returning all the data.  Use CMSpectrum to get%     spectral data.%% XYZ = CMETER('XYZ')%		Send a command to the colorimeter to return the 1931 CIE X, Y, and Z data.%		Y is specified in cd/m^2.%% Yxy = CMETER('Yxy')% 	Send a command to the colorimeter to return the Luminance (1931 CIE Y)% 	and the 1931 CIE x and y.% 	Y is specified in cd/m^2.%% Ytd = CM('Ytd')%	 	Send a command to the colorimeter to return the Luminance (1931 CIE Y)% 	and the Correlated Color Temperature in Kelvins (t) and the % 	deviation of color coordinates from in ideal Planckian radiator% 	in 1960 CIE u-v units (d) (+ indicates the coordinates lie above% 	the Planckian locus).%% Yuv = CM('Yuv')% 	Send a command to the colorimeter to return the Luminance (1931 CIE Y)% 	and the 1976 CIE u' and v' data.% 	Y is specified in cd/m^2.%% CMETER('CTS',value)% 	Reset or set the CTS line on the serial port.  Value can be 0 or 1.%% NOTE:  This routine sometimes gets munged in Matlab's memory.  The symptom% is that the Matlab interpreter cannot find it.  We haven't been able to% track down the problem, but typing "clear mex" usually fixes it. Presumably% we have some sort of pointer error somewhere.%% (Note from xmz: I haven't noticed this on the Windows platform. I guess if it% is a pointer error in the Cmeter code, it will eventually show up ...)%% 12/4/96  dhb  Updated help.% 9/25/98  xmz	Added a few comments about the PC version.% 7/13/00  dgp  Note obsolescence.
