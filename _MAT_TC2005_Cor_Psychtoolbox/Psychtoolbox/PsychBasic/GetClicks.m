function [clicks,x,y] = GetClicks% [clicks,x,y] = GetClicks([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])%% Wait for the user to click the mouse, count the number of clicks% that occur within a system inter-click interval of each other, and% then return the number of clicks and the mouse location.% % The x,y location is the location at the downstroke of the first mouse% click. The mouse position (x,y) is "local", i.e. relative to the origin of% the window or screen, if supplied; otherwise it's "global", i.e. relative% to the origin of the main screen (the one with the menu bar).%% The allowed inter-click interval can be adjusted in the Mouse% Control Panel: "double-click speed". The Macintosh function% GetDblTime (or Windows GetDoubleClickTime) returns the % value of this constant, in Ticks. It can be set by LMSetDoubleTime.%% POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENT? If a sound was playing (see Snd), it is stopped % at the first mouse click. (The two MEX files don't communicate at present.)%% See Also: GetMouse, SetMouse% 5/12/96  dgp  Wrote it.% 5/16/96  dhb  Wrote as MEX-file, updated help.% 6/7/96   dhb  Modified as per Pelli suggestion to respond to cmd-.%          dhb  Modified as per Pelli suggestion to stop any playing sound.% 8/23/96  dhb  Added support for windowPtr argument.% 3/10/97  dgp	windowPtrOrScreenNumber% 6/10/02  awi	Added See Also.
