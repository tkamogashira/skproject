function PrepareScreen(screenNumber,screenInfo)% PrepareScreen, if present, is called by Screen 'OpenWindow' when the first% window is opened on a particular screen. PrepareScreen.m is intended to be% the single file that configures each screen (i.e. the graphics driver)% to attain standard driver-independent performance. PrepareScreen doesn't % change the pixelSize or resolution.% % Win: at present PrepareScreen does nothing; it's ok to call it.% % If you want to work with a screen before opening a window, you should% explicitly call PrepareScreen. It's harmless to call it more than once.% For each screen, it sets an "open" flag the first time you call it and% returns immediately if that screen is already open. You may call% PrepareScreen freely. If in doubt, call it.% % You can force PrepareScreen to run again in earnest, redoing all the% work, by first calling RestoreScreen, which clears the "open" flag. See% also RestoreScreen.% % Our intention is that this be the ONLY file that distinguishes specific% graphic drivers. We hope that you will never have to, as that would make% your programs much less portable. We have identified a number of% operational parameters that vary among drivers and that need to be taken% into account when loading the CLUT. Most users won't need to know these% parameters, but if you do, please use them instead of making your code% refer to any drivers by name.% % The main task of PrepareScreen is to set the following Screen Preference% values:%   BlankingDuration% 	DipPriorityAfterSetClut% 	MaximumSetClutPriority% 	MinimumSetClutPriority% 	MinimumEntriesForSetClutToWaitForBlanking% 	UseHighGammaBits% 	DacBits% 	SetClutDuplicates8Bits% 	AskSetClutDriverToWaitForBlanking% 	SetClutCallsWaitBlanking% It also sets:% 	screenGlobal(s).fixATIRadeon7000% % The values are succintly reported by DescribeScreenPrefs. It only % reports unusual non-standard values, omitting the standard ones.% % These parameters are important, but their best settings are hard to% figure out. You can't just ask the driver. Most of them are best% determined by running ScreenTest and looking over the report. If% necessary, we then add driver-specific conditionals here in% PrepareScreen to set up the parameters to achieve standard% machine-independent operation.% % WAIT FOR BLANKING: We set Screen parameters so that SetClut will wait% for blanking. There are many avenues to achieving that behavior; the% last resort is to ask it to wait for the blanking interrupt. See% ClutTimeTest, LoadClut, and Screen 'SetClut' and 'WaitBlanking'.% % MORE-THAN-8-BIT DACS: Some graphics cards have more-than-8-bit DACs. It% used to be tricky to load the CLUT and control all the bits, but we've% done all the work for you. You can just call LoadClut. We set various% Screen parameters appropriately for each of your graphics cards. See% LoadClut. The first call to LoadClut will be slow, as it prepares all % the tables. Subsequent calls should take only slightly longer than a % call to Screen 'SetClut'.% % UseHighGammaBits: There are only two possibilities, so we try both and% choose the one that minimizes error. This should automatically cope with% all new drivers.% 4/21/02 dgp Wrote it.% 6/20/02 dgp Rewrote it, incorporating the contents of ScreenUsesHighGammaBits and ScreenDacBits.% 6/21/02 dgp The ATI Radeon 7000 does NOT use the high gamma bits (i'm sure), despite being "Generation 2" (not sure).% 6/24/02 dgp Correct the polarity of the test for ScreenUsesHighGammaBits.

Raynald Comtois% <raco@burrhus.harvard.edu> suggested the idea to me in 1992. If one is% using interrupts, excess counting can arise through faulty hardware that% generates multiple interrupts. If one is using SetClut to wait for% blanking, the driver may allow many quick calls during a single% blanking. Both problems are solved by setting BlankingDuration to 3 ms,% but we never checked to find out how low it could be set and still solve% the problem. Just before the 2.52 release we learned from bug reports% (Anthony Helou, David Jones, and David Brainard) that setting% BlankingDuration to 3 ms causes tears in CLUT animations on the Radeon% 7200, and that the tearing is cured by setting BlankingDuration to zero.% However, David Jones reports multiple counting of the blanking on his% Radeon 7200 unless the BlankingDuration is at least 0.2 ms. Looking at% his results for the Radeon 7200 and the ATI Rage128Pro (AGP), it appears% that 0.3 ms would be a good value for both of those cards. So, for the% time being, we're setting the default value to 0.0003. 8/24/02 dgp.% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/message/1320 ;% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/message/1453 ;if (isATIRadeon10Gen1 | isATIRadeon10Gen2)	Screen(screenNumber,'Preference','BlankingDuration',0.003); % 1 mselse	Screen(screenNumber,'Preference','BlankingDuration',0.0003); % 0.3 msend	% Thinking that it was better to do nothing than to do harm by setting the% default too high, we zeroed it, in PrepareScreen, unless a runtime test% indicated that 3 ms helped.
