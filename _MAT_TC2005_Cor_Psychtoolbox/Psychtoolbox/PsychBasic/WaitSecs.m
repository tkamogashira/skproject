function WaitSecs(s)% WaitSecs(s)%% Waits "s" seconds (with high precision). Uses the extremely accurate% PowerPC processor clock if the UpTime trap is available (PowerMac % with Mac OS 8.6 or better). Otherwise uses the Time Manager's% Microseconds trap. The Time Manager seems to lose time when% interrupts are suppressed, whereas UpTime is unaffected.% % WaitSecs(s) is similar to Matlab's built-in PAUSE(s) command. The% advantage of WaitSecs(s) is that it is much more accurate, and can% be aborted by hitting Command-Period. However, PAUSE can be turned% 'ON' and 'OFF', which is useful for scripts.% % TIMING ADVICE: the first time you access any MEX function or M file,% Matlab takes several hundred milliseconds to load it from disk.% Allocating a variable takes time too. Usually you'll want to omit% those delays from your timing measurements by making sure all the% functions you use are loaded and that all the variables you use are% allocated, before you start timing. MEX files stay loaded until you% flush the MEX files (e.g. by changing directory or calling CLEAR% MEX). M files and variables stay in memory until you clear them.%% GetSecs, WaitSecs, and several other MEX files use the VideoToolbox% Seconds.c function as their timebase. Seconds.c uses the Mac OS% UpTime trap if available. This trap is based on a hardware counter% in the PowerPC processor, which provides extremely stable reliable% timing. However, the Mac OS conversion from a count to a time uses% an Apple-supplied conversion factor that is only accurate to about% 1%. To make your timing more accurate you can scale all values% returned by Seconds.c by setting the scale factor different from 1% in Screen Preference SecondsMultiplier. Run GetSecsTest to do this% automatically. % % See also: GetSecs, GetTicks, WaitTicks, PAUSE.% 1/29/97  dhb  Wrote it.% 3/15/97 dgp  Expanded comments.% 2/22/99 dgp  Mention PAUSE.% 2/4/00 dgp  Updated for Mac OS 9.
