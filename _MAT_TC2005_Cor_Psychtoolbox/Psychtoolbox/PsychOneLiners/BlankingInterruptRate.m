function hz=BlankingInterruptRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,secs)% hz=BlankingInterruptRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,[secs])% Quickly and accurately measures the frames per second of the "blanking"% interrupt associated with the specified screen. (In nearly all cases the% "blanking" interrupt occurs at blanking time, but Michael Bache reported% that for one powerbook model the "blanking" interrupt in fact occurs at% each System Tick, with no relation at all to the actual display.) The% optional argument "secs" specifies how long to spend doing the% measurement (for each screen/window), but we always wait for at least% one frame; default of 0.1 sec yields accuracy of 0.1 Hz or better.% % The argument "windowPtrOrScreenNumber" can be an array of such;% BlankingInterruptRate will return a corresponding array of frame rates.% % HOW WE DO IT: PeekBlanking provides the time of occurrence of blanking% interrupts. Occasionally a blanking interrupt may be delayed by% unrelated interruptions. The measured time between interrupts will be% shortened if the first interrupt is delayed, and lengthened if the% second interrupt is delayed. We minimize the occurrence of unrelated% interruptions by using Rush. We reduce the loss of accuracy by timing a% multi-frame interval. % % Usually you'll want to call FrameRate instead. It's more reliable if% what you really want to know is the display's frame rate.% % See FrameRate and ScreenTest.% % Denis Pelli 28 February 1998% 2/28/98 dgp Wrote it.% 3/1/98  dgp Allow windowPtrOrScreenNumber to be an array.% 3/14/98  dgp Add secs argument.% 7/14/98  dgp Renamed from "FrameRate" to "BlankingInterruptRate".% 7/17/98	dgp   Using enhanced Rush, use easy-to-read cell array for string.% 7/21/98	dgp We were getting confusing warnings when running on ixMicro TwinTurbo card because%			it suppresses interrupts for the whole frame when you call SetClut. WaitBlanking 23%			wasn't allowing any interrupts so the interrupt-driven frame and time meters didn't advance.%			So, when SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking is true, we abandon interrupt-based timing and instead%			use the new count and time that are saved at the end of every SetClut. This can be done%			at high priority, resulting in a very accurate measurement.% 7/21/98 dgp Make sure all Rushed functions are in memory.% 8/1/98 dgp Always return the interrupt rate. Ignore SetClut.% 8/1/98 dgp Tidy up the warning.if nargin<1 | nargin>2 | nargout>1 | ~isa(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'double') | isempty(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)	error('Usage: hz=BlankingInterruptRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,[secs])');endif nargin<2	secs=0.1;endif length(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)>1	% windowPtrOrScreenNumber is array	hz=windowPtrOrScreenNumber;	for i=1:length(windowPtrOrScreenNumber(:))		hz(i)=BlankingInterruptRate(windowPtrOrScreenNumber(i),secs);	endelse	% windowPtrOrScreenNumber is scalar	w=windowPtrOrScreenNumber;	reps=1;	frames=ceil(max(1,secs*75/reps)); % assume roughly 75 Hz in choosing how many frames to time.	ii=0;f0=0;s0=0;f=0;s=0;Screen('Screens');GetSecs; % load into memory	string={		'for ii=1;'			'Screen(w,''WaitBlanking'');'			'secs=GetSecs;'			'[f0,s0]=Screen(w,''PeekBlanking'');'			'Screen(w,''WaitBlanking'',frames);'			'secs=GetSecs-secs;'			'[f,s]=Screen(w,''PeekBlanking'');'		'end;'	};	% time blanking interrupt	waitBlankingAlwaysCallsSetClut=Screen(w,'Preference','WaitBlankingAlwaysCallsSetClut',0);	interruptPunchesBlankingClock=Screen(w,'Preference','InterruptPunchesBlankingClock',1);	p=MaxPriority(w,'WaitBlanking','PeekBlanking','GetSecs','BlankingInterrupt');	r=zeros(1,reps);	for i=1:reps		Rush(string,p);		f=f-f0;		s=s-s0;		old=warning;		warning off		r(i)=f/s;		warning(old)		if r(i)==0 | ~isfinite(r(i))			string=sprintf('During Screen(w,''WaitBlanking'',%.0f), rushed at priority %.1g, the \nframe counter advanced %d and time advanced %.0f ms.',frames,p,f,s*1000);			if f==0				string=sprintf('%s The frame counter \nisn''t advancing.',string);			else				string=sprintf('%s Either WaitBlanking \nisn''t waiting or GetSecs isn''t advancing.
