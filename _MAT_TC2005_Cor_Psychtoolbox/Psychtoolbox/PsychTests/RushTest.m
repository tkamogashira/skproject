function RushTest% RushTest measures the variation in speed of a simple loop over time, and% assesses the effectiveness of the Rush MEX function in minimizing the% Mac OS and device driver interruptions that cause the variation. Rush% runs the Matlab loop as a deferred task or at raised processor priority% to prevent most of the interruptions. RushTest revealed that the Iomega% 5.03 driver installed by Mac OS 7.6.1 to support Zip and Jaz drives is a% particularly bad offender, stealing 2 ms every 3 seconds, which wreaks% havok in any attempt to control a real-time process, or display a% real-time movie. (The Zip and Jaz interrupts can be eliminated simply by% stuffing disks into the empty drives to eliminate the endless scanning% of empty drives.) LoopTest.m is a minimal version of this file, using% only standard Matlab functions.% % See Rush and Priority.%% ANALYSIS% In the absence of the Iomega 5.03 driver, most of the activity at % priorityLevel 0.5 seems to be due to a roughly 0.6 ms interrupt that % occurs about once per 2 ms. % % The histogram of durations of a nominally 1 ms interval is log-linear:% Frequency falls off by a decade per 0.3 ms. The histogram of nominally% 10 ms interval durations falls off by a decade per 0.6 ms. With my% current bin size of about 0.25 ms, the mode is at the nominal duration% and has about 50% of the intervals, the max is in a bin at 1.2 ms longer% and holds about 0.2% (not far below 0.5 10^-2) of the intervals.% Extrapolating, going out six times 0.6 ms, we'd expect only 0.5 10^-6 of% the intervals to be 3.6 ms longer than the nominal. In the course of a 1% s stimulus we'd expect a probability of 100*0.5 10^-6=1/5000 of% exceeding a nominal 10 ms interval by 3.6 ms or more. That's probably% rare enough to be negligible.% % CONCLUSION% At priorityLevel 0.5 you should allow about 3.6 ms of slack in any 10 ms % loop synchronized to an external event to be confident of never missing % a beat. I.e. if you're synchronizing to a 100 Hz display, you'll need % to move few enough pixels to remain idle for about 1/3 of the time.% 4/12/97 dgp Wrote it.% 4/23/97 dgp Updated.
