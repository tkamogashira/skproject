% BitPlaneDemo%% Demo program to show how to store binary images% in each of 8 bit planes.  Here we just show% some square waves of different spatial frequencies,% but the image in each plane can be arbitrary.% 4/8/97  dhb  Wrote it in response to question from Lenny Kontsevich.% 3/12/98   dgp   Use Ask.% 4/3/99   dgp   Force 8-bit mode, since the program assumes it.% 4/08/02  awi  Added conditionals for Windows.% Generate eight binary squarewave images.% Scale each to the appropriate bit plane.% (The scale factor is simply 2^(i-1), where% i = 1,...,8.)imSize = 128;im1 = (2^(1-1))*MakeSquareBP(1,imSize);im2 = (2^(2-1))*MakeSquareBP(2,imSize);im3 = (2^(3-1))*MakeSquareBP(3,imSize);im4 = (2^(4-1))*MakeSquareBP(4,imSize);im5 = (2^(5-1))*MakeSquareBP(5,imSize);im6 = (2^(6-1))*MakeSquareBP(6,imSize);im7 = (2^(7-1))*MakeSquareBP(7,imSize);im8 = (2^(8-1))*MakeSquareBP(8,imSize);% Set up some lookup tables.
