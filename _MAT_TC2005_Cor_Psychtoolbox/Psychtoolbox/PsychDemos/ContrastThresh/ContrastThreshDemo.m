% ContrastThreshDemo%% Demonstration of measuring contrast thresholds in noise.%% Subprograms end with suffix "CT" to help keep the name% space unpolluted.%% BUGS: Student Matlab 5.0 sometimes hangs up in a call to CmdWinToUpperLeft(),% and continues if you hit Command-Period. Matlab 5.1 and 5.2 are ok.% 6/24/96  dgp  Wrote it.% 3/8/97   dhb  Vastly simplified dgp's version.  This makes it%               much less close to a real experiment but%               correspondingly easier to read.% 1/12/98  dgp  Noted problem with Student Matlab.% Set parametersimageSize = 64;			  			% Image size in pixelsexpandSize = 2;							% Amount to expand image for displaycyclesPerImage = 3;					% Spatial freq, c/image.spaceConstant=imageSize/4;	% Gaussian grating envelopedurationMs = 200;						% Trial duration 	 	nTrials = 20;								% Number of trialsnoiseRmsContrast=0.2;				% Noise contrastscreenNumber = 0;						% Which screen are we running on?% Run the experiment.RunExperimentCT;
