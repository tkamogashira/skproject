function x=RandSample(list,dims)% x=RandSample(list,[dims])% Returns a random sample from a list. The optional second argument may be% used to request an array (of size dims) of independent samples. E.g.% RandSample(-1:1,[10,10]) returns a 10x10 array of samples from the list -1:1. % RandSample is a quick way to generate samples (e.g. visual noise) from a bounded% Gaussian distribution. Also see RAND, RANDN, Randi, Sample, and Shuffle.% % "list" must be a vector. In the future, we may accept matrices and treat% columns separately, as other Matlab functions do.% Denis Pelli 7/22/97 3/24/98% 8/14/99 dgp Renamed from "Rands" (which conflicts with Neural Net Toolbox) to%             "RandSample".% 6/22/02 dgp Fixed bug. The shape specified by dims was being lost in the table-lookup%             through "list". I was asking for 256x1 and getting 1x256. Now fixed.if nargin<1 | nargin>2 | min(size(list))~=1	error('Usage: i=RandSample(list,[dims])')endif nargin==1	dims=1;endx=ceil(length(list)*rand(dims));x(:)=list(x(:));
