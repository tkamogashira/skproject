function q=QuestCreate(tGuess,tGuessSd,pThreshold,beta,delta,gamma,grain,range)% q=QuestCreate(tGuess,tGuessSd,pThreshold,beta,delta,gamma,[grain],[range])% Create a struct q with all the information necessary to measure% threshold. Threshold "t" is measured on an abstract "intensity"% scale, which usually corresponds to log10 contrast.% % QuestCreate saves in struct q the parameters for a Weibull psychometric function:% p2=delta*gamma+(1-delta)*(1-(1-gamma)*exp(-10.^(beta*(x2+xThreshold))));% where x represents log10 contrast relative to threshold. The Weibull% function itself appears only in QuestRecompute, which uses the% specified parameter values in q to compute a psychometric function% and store it in q. All the other Quest functions simply use the% psychometric function stored in "q". QuestRecompute is called solely% by QuestCreate and QuestBetaAnalysis (and possibly by a few user% programs). Thus, if you prefer to use a different kind of% psychometric function, called Foo, you need only create your own% QuestCreateFoo, QuestRecomputeFoo, and (if you need it)% QuestBetaAnalysisFoo, based on QuestCreate, QuestRecompute, and% QuestBetaAnalysis, and you can use them with the rest of the Quest% package unchanged. You would only be changing a few lines of code,% so it would quite easy to do.% % tGuess is your prior threshold estimate.% tGuessSd is the standard deviation you assign to that guess.% pThreshold is your threshold criterion expressed as probability of %	response==1. An intensity offset is introduced into the psychometric %	function so that threshold (i.e. the midpoint of the table) yields %	pThreshold.% beta, delta, and gamma are the parameters of a Weibull psychometric function.% beta controls the steepness of the psychometric function. Typically 3.5.% delta is the fraction of trials on which the observer presses blindly. %	Typically 0.01.% gamma is the fraction of trials that will generate response 1 when %	intensity==-inf.% grain is the quantization of the internal table. E.g. 0.01.% range is the intensity difference between the largest and smallest %	intensity that the internal table can store. E.g. 5. This interval will% 	be centered on the initial guess tGuess, i.e. [tGuess-range/2, tGuess+range/2].% 	QUEST assumes that intensities outside of this interval% 	have zero prior probability, i.e. they are impossible.% % See QuestCreate, QuestUpdate, QuestQuantile, QuestMean, QuestMode,% QuestSd, and QuestSimulate.% 6/8/96   dgp  Wrote it.% 6/11/96  dgp  Optimized the order of stuffing for faster unstuffing.% 11/10/96 dhb  Added warning about correctness after DGP told me.% 3/1/97   dgp  Fixed error in sign of xThreshold in formula for p2.% 3/1/97   dgp  Updated to use Matlab 5 structs.% 3/3/97   dhb  Added missing semi-colon to first struct eval.% 3/5/97   dgp  Fixed sd: use exp instead of 10^.% 3/5/97   dgp  Added some explanation of the psychometric function.% 6/24/97   dgp  For simulations, now allow specification of grain and dim.% 9/30/98	dgp	Added "dim" fix from Richard Murray.% 4/12/99 dgp dropped support for Matlab 4.% 5/6/99 dgp Simplified "dim" calculation; just round up to even integer.% 8/15/99   dgp  Explain how to use other kind of psychometric function.% 2/10/02   dgp  Document grain and range.% % Copyright (c) 1996-1999 Denis Pelliif nargin<6 | nargin>8	error('Usage: q=QuestCreate(tGuess,tGuessSd,pThreshold,beta,delta,gamma,[grain],[range])')endif nargin<7	grain=0.01;endif nargin<8	dim=500;else	if range<=0		error('"range" must be greater than zero.')	end	dim=range/grain;	dim=2*ceil(dim/2);	% round up to an even integerendq.updatePdf=1; % boolean, 1 for yesq.warnPdf=1; % boolean, 1 for yesq.normalizePdf=0;q.tGuess=tGuess;q.tGuessSd=tGuessSd;q.pThreshold=pThreshold;q.beta=beta;q.delta=delta;q.gamma=gamma;q.grain=grain;q.dim=dim;q=QuestRecompute(q);% THIS CODE WAS IN THE OLD VERSION.
